                    Boston University's AI4ALL program. Since then, Brigid has worked with Dara on a presentation to her school's STEM Pathway organization about how Algorithmic Bias occurs in the justice system.</p1>

                        of 7 other students from across the country in discussions about algorithmic bias. This group is creating a report on the state of federal legislation on facial recognition in the US. They will also create a website.
